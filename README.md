# Mobile Application for IoT-Enabled Weather Monitoring System

This Flutter-based mobile application serves as the user interface for the IoT-enabled weather monitoring system, providing real-time data visualization and control capabilities. Built for Android and iOS (release version available for Android), the app integrates Firebase for data storage and user authentication, ensuring secure and seamless access to environmental data.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**:  
  Displays live temperature and humidity readings from connected sensors, updating every 15 seconds.
- **Historical Data Visualization**:  
  Fetch and plot temperature and humidity trends from Firebase over custom time periods, enabling comprehensive environmental analysis.
- **Energy Consumption Insights**:  
  View estimated energy consumption data generated by the ATmega328P, visualized as energy-time graphs for better understanding of system efficiency.
- **User Authentication**:  
  Secured with Firebase Authentication to prevent unauthorized access to weather data.

This application bridges the gap between IoT hardware and end-users, providing an intuitive platform to monitor and analyze environmental conditions while optimizing system performance.
